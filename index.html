						I started my working career as a shift manager in fast food. After two years, I worked my way into a one of Austin's most renowned kitchens as a shift lead and learned what it takes to make serve quality product in a high-stress and high-pressure environment.		
						</br></br>
						When I wasn't in the kitchen, I built my own business, selling beautiful laser-cut wooden boxes to players of Magic: The Gathering. This grew into an interest in marketing and online business.
						</br></br>
						I then used my experience building my business to get a job in marketing, helping the viral marketing tool Viralsweep conceptualize and build an influencer network, enabling brands using Viralsweep to hire influencers to promote their campaigns.
						</br></br>
						Working with the Viralsweep team helped me realize an interest beyond physical product and marketing. When the project completed, I wanted to learn how to program and create tools of my own. So I started <b><a target="_blank"href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School's</a></b> Full Stack Web Development track. Below are samples of my projects built over the past 9 months.
						</br></br>
						After graduating from Lambda School's Web Development program I got together with my Brother to build Roundtable while I was on the job hunt. 6 months into the hunt I landed a job at Quikserve Solutions a Point of Sale SaaS company where I was hired on as a software developer.

										<h3 class="icon fa-image">Lessons Learned</h3>
										<p>While at Quikserve I have learned a lot about programming. The largest thing I have learned at Quikserve has been how to be flexible in what environment I work in.</p> 
										<p>Since starting at Quikserve I started working in TSReact, then moved to GO for the first time. After working shortly in GO I started working with C#, shortly after the project scope changed, we got rid of the C# code base and moved to a 100% Rust project. Moving between so many different languages in such a short time has been really enlighening to learn how each language and environment works differently.</p>

										<p>The Roundtable team consists of myself and the designer. Throught out the whole project I have been working side by side with the designer offering input on his initial design.

										<h3 class="icon fa-image">Lessons Learned</h3>
										<p>Working on such a small team to build Roundtable has been really insightful, we're able to complete tasks quickly but we can quickly end up bottle necking each other if we do not communicate properly. On Mission Control I was primarliy a database developer, now that I'm working extensively on the Database and Frontend and I have learned what to look out for and what questions to ask while designing a database. To piggy back off that, I have also learned what kind of information would be crucial for a database designer to know while developing a web application.</p>

										<p>Working on Mission Control was my favorite part of Lambda. I learned how to work with new technology (Okta, Apollo, Prisma, Docker) and manage weekly stakeholder meetings.

										<h3 class="icon fa-comment">Objective</h3>
										<p>When I joined the team at Viralsweep I worked closely with the co-founders to come up with a way for users to connect. We developed an in-app network that connects brands, influencers, and agencies who use giveaways to grow their business.  I noticed influencers were more than twice as likely to join the network if they filled out a survey first, rather than just a cold email, so we scaled this effort up and created collaborativeÂ supplementary content using all of the survey data. </p>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">

										<h3 class="icon solid fa-sync">What I did</h3>
										<p>After creating a plan for Voices, I hit the ground running and reached out to and interviewed upwards of 150+ influencers. Through these interviews I built working relations with these influencers and I was able to recruit them to our network in order for them to partner up with brands in their field.</p>

										<p>Working on Voices was a key part in my journey into becoming a programmer, it introduced me into different ways of automation and constantly pushed me out of my comfort zone. The whole project lasted about a year before the team (my-self included) decided that Voices and the influencer network did not align with the company's vision. This decision was what ultimately led me to Lambda School and web development in general. </p>

										<h3 class="icon fa-comment">Objective</h3>
										<p>I was in a time of transition during 2015 and had been talking to my new mentor for a few months having mentioned that I wanted to start my own business. My mentor and I got talking and I had an interest in Magic: The Gathering at the time, so we decided to work together and come up with a product in the Trading Card Game field. We then met with an Industrial Designer who had recently been laid off and got to talking and decided to start Asgard Gear creating beautiful deck boxes for MTG players.</p>
									</section>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<section>
										<h3 class="icon solid fa-sync">What I did</h3>
										<p>While starting Asgard Gear I was in charge of marketing, supply chain, productions, and assembly. I ran online marketing campaigns on the MTG subreddit. Sourced Walnut and acrylic sheets online, subscribed to a maker space to produce the necessary pieces and then assembled them all together for shipment. </p>
									</section>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<section>
										<h3 class="icon fa-image">Lessons Learned</h3>
										<p>I would say that Asgard Gear has been one of the best teachers for me, I learned how to start and run a busniess from the ground up, prototyping, marketing, and supply chain.  Being able to try out every aspect of running a buisness is what sent me into marketing and how I ended up at Viralsweep. Then after Viralseep, having to outsource my websites creation for Asgard is another major contributing factor to me now being a we b developer.</p>
