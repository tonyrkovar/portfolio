						I started my working career as a shift manager in fast food. After two years, I worked my way into a one of Austin's most renowned kitchens as a shift lead and learned what it takes to make serve quality product in a high-stress and high-pressure environment.		
						</br></br>
						When I wasn't in the kitchen, I built my own business, selling beautiful laser-cut wooden boxes to players of Magic: The Gathering. This grew into an interest in marketing and online business.
						</br></br>
						I then used my experience building my business to get a job in marketing, helping the viral marketing tool ViralSweep conceptualize and build an influencer network, enabling brands using ViralSweep to hire influencers to promote their campaigns.
						</br></br>
						Working with the ViralSweep team helped me realize an interest beyond physical product and marketing. When the project completed, I wanted to learn how to program and create tools of my own. Enter, <b><a target="_blank"href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a></b>. Below are samples of my projects built over the past 9 months.

										<p>For one week I worked on a cross functional team of Data Science and Web students to create a one stop shop to find all of Hacker News' saltiest users are. The only API avalible to me in this project was my Data Scientists Flask application which did not have a user flow so I had to reuse a a java backend from a previous project. </p>

										<p>This project was a really interesting challenge, my Backend enginer was MIA for the full week so I had to improvise a userflow to reach MVP. And I acted as a mentor to the other Web Developer who was just finishing their first unit of react(3 weeks of instruction). I learned a lot in this project and had to step up and solve a large amount of problems that came up constantly.</p>

										<p>When I joined the team at Viralsweep I worked closely with the co-founders to come up with a network that helped connect their current users to influencers in their field. We came up with the idea of Voices as a means to connect influencers on their "Promote" network with brands that used Viralsweep to run their marketing campaigns.</p>

										<p>Voices was a really interesting project, I was able to work closely with one of Viralsweeps co-founders almost daily and learn a lot from him. While the project was on going I had a lot of fun working with the influencers I was reaching out to and getting to look into their world.</p>

										<p>I was in a time of transition during 2015 and had been talking to my new mentor for a few months having mentioned that I wanted to start my own business. My mentor and I got talking and I had an interest in Magic: The Gathering at the time, so we decided to work together and come up with a product in the Trading Card Game field. We then met with an Industrial Designer who had recently been laid off and got to talking and decided to start Asgard Gear creating beautiful deck boxes for MTG players.</p>

										<h3 class="icon solid fa-sync">What I did</h3>
										<p>While starting Asgard Gear I was in charge of marketing, supply chain, productions, and assembly. I ran online marketing campaigns on the MTG subreddit. Sourced Walnut and acrylic sheets online, subscribed to a maker space to produce the necessary pieces and then assembled them all together for shipment. </p>

										<h3 class="icon fa-image">Thoughts</h3>
										<p>Asgard Gear ultimately did not work out because I lost interest in the marketing aspect, I couldn't feign interest in MTG long enough. But I learned so much by starting and running the company that it is an invaluable experience for me.</p>
