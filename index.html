					The first decade of my working life I spent my time in the service industry. There I learned many
					valuable lessons about task prioritization, having a sense of urgency, teamwork, and management.
					</br></br>
					During this time when I had some down time I wanted to build something for myself, and since I
					wasn't a programmer yet, I worked with a designer I met online to build gorgeous laser cut wooden
					deck boxes for Magic: The Gathering. This cultivated and interest in marketing and building things
					while my time in kitches gave me a sense of creativity.
					</br></br>
					I then used my experience building my business to get a job in marketing, helping the viral
					marketing tool Viralsweep conceptualize and build an influencer network, enabling brands using
					Viralsweep to hire influencers to promote their campaigns.
					</br></br>
					Working with the Viralsweep team helped me realize an interest beyond physical product and
					marketing. When the project completed, I wanted to learn how to program and create tools of my own.
					So I started <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomtech.com/">Lambda School(Now
							Bloomtech)</a></b> Full Stack Web Development track.
					</br></br>
					After finishing from Lambda School's Web Development program I got together with my Brother to build
					Roundtable while I was on the job hunt. 6 months into the hunt I landed a job at Quikserve Solutions
					a Point of Sale SaaS company where I was hired on as a software developer.
					<br></br>
					After six months at Quikserve I had a desire for a different experience as a Developer. Quikserve
					was too unstructured for how junior of a developer I was. Which lead me to a position at
					Qubika(Formerly Moove-it). While at Qubika I have been able to work with multiple teams of amazing
					developers to build out interesting projects.
					The main client that I landed on at Qubika is <a target="_blank"
						href="https://www.reciprocityhealth.com/">Reciprocity Health</a>. An application that partners
					with clients to incentivise their members to lead healthier lifestyles.

									<p>While at Qubika I've had the oppurtunity to learn a lot of skills associated with

									<p>Since starting at Quikserve I started working on a React application using

										the first time. After working shortly in GO I started working with C#, shortly
										after the project scope changed, we got rid of the C# code base and moved to a
										100% Rust project. Moving between so many different languages in such a short
										time has been really enlighening to learn how each language and environment
										works differently.</p>

									<p>Working on such a small team to build Roundtable has been really insightful,
										we're able to complete tasks quickly but we can quickly end up bottle necking
										each other if we do not communicate properly. On Mission Control I was primarliy
										a database developer, now that I'm working extensively on the Database and
										Frontend and I have learned what to look out for and what questions to ask while
										designing a database. To piggy back off that, I have also learned what kind of
										information would be crucial for a database designer to know while developing a
										web application.</p>

									<p>When I joined the team at Viralsweep I worked closely with the co-founders to
										come up with a way for users to connect. We developed an in-app network that
										connects brands, influencers, and agencies who use giveaways to grow their
										business. I noticed influencers were more than twice as likely to join the
										network if they filled out a survey first, rather than just a cold email, so we
										scaled this effort up and created collaborative supplementary content using all

									<p>After creating a plan for Voices, I hit the ground running and reached out to and

									<p>Working on Voices was a key part in my journey into becoming a programmer, it

										company's vision. This decision was what ultimately led me to Lambda School and
										web development in general. </p>

									<p>I was in a time of transition during 2015 and had been talking to my new mentor
										for a few months having mentioned that I wanted to start my own business. My
										mentor and I got talking and I had an interest in Magic: The Gathering at the
										time, so we decided to work together and come up with a product in the Trading
										Card Game field. We then met with an Industrial Designer who had recently been
										laid off and got to talking and decided to start Asgard Gear creating beautiful
										deck boxes for MTG players.</p>
								</section>

							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<section>
									<h3 class="icon solid fa-sync">What I did</h3>
									<p>While starting Asgard Gear I was in charge of marketing, supply chain,
										productions, and assembly. I ran online marketing campaigns on the MTG
										subreddit. Sourced Walnut and acrylic sheets online, subscribed to a maker space
										to produce the necessary pieces and then assembled them all together for
										shipment. </p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<section>
									<h3 class="icon fa-image">Lessons Learned</h3>
									<p>I would say that Asgard Gear has been one of the best teachers for me, I learned
										how to start and run a busniess from the ground up, prototyping, marketing, and
										supply chain. Being able to try out every aspect of running a buisness is what
										sent me into marketing and how I ended up at Viralsweep. Then after Viralseep,
										having to outsource my websites creation for Asgard is another major
										contributing factor to me now being a we b developer.</p>
